🏡 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts house prices using Linear Regression based on features like bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and age of the house.
It covers Data Preprocessing → EDA → Model Training → Evaluation → Saving Model → Prediction.

📂 Project Features
✔️ 1. Load Dataset

Loads a CSV file with 700 records containing:

Bedrooms

Bathrooms

Sqft

Location

Age_of_House

Price

✔️ 2. Data Cleaning & Exploration

Checks for missing values

Displays dataset structure

Generates statistical summary

Shows sample rows

✔️ 3. Feature Engineering

Converts Location (categorical) to numeric using One-Hot Encoding

Prepares data for Linear Regression

Avoids dummy variable trap using drop_first=True

✔️ 4. Train–Test Split

80% Training data

20% Testing data

Used to check the performance of the model on unseen data.

✔️ 5. Model Training

Uses LinearRegression from scikit-learn:

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

✔️ 6. Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

R² Score

A high R² score confirms strong model performance.

✔️ 7. Model Interpretation

The model prints:

Coefficients of each feature

Intercept

How much each feature contributes to final price prediction

✔️ 8. Save Trained Model

Model is saved using Joblib:

house_price_model.pkl


This allows reuse without retraining.

✔️ 9. Example Prediction

Example input:

{
    "Bedrooms": 3,
    "Bathrooms": 2,
    "Sqft": 1500,
    "Age_of_House": 20,
    "Location_Coastal": 1,
    "Location_Hill Area": 0,
    "Location_Industrial": 0,
    "Location_Suburb": 0
}


Returns predicted price.

✔️ 10. Correlation Heatmap

A heatmap is included to visualize feature relationships:

sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")


Helps understand how features affect house prices.
